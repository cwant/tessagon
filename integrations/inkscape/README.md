Usage is `python3 package_extension.py`.

The script `package_extension.py` packages up the inkscape extension in the
`output` directory. It depends on the `python-minifier` package (`pip3 install python-minifier`). It writes to a directory called `inkscape-tiling-extension`, which gets compressed to the file `inkscape-tiling-extension.zip`.
